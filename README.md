# searchingAlgorithms
This repository features Depth First Search (Stack) and Breadth First Search using Python. These two are most commonly used searching algorithms which find paths from a start Node to a goal Node. I have explained each statement in detail for better understanding. I have also uploaded uncommented versions incase you want to copy it. :)
